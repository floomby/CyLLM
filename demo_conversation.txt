Joe: Hey Fred, you know I was thinking, aren't crabs and lobsters pretty much the same thing? 
Fred: Hmm, they might seem similar Joe, but there are quite a few differences between the two. 
Joe: Really? They're both crustaceans, right? They both have exoskeletons and they both live in the water.
Fred: Yes, that's true, but those are basic traits of all crustaceans. Saying crabs and lobsters are the same because of those traits would be like saying humans and gorillas are the same because we're both primates.
Joe: Okay, I see your point. But what makes them so different then?
Fred: Well, for one, their body structure is different. Lobsters have a long body with a tail and large claws. Crabs, on the other hand, have a compact, round body and smaller claws.
Joe: Oh, right. And lobsters are much bigger too, right?
Fred: They typically are, yes. Plus, lobsters and crabs belong to different families under the order of Decapoda. Lobsters belong to the Nephropidae family, while crabs are part of the Brachyura. 
Joe: Huh, I never knew that. But they both taste good, don't they?
Fred: Haha, well, that's a matter of personal taste, Joe. I'll agree with you on that one!
